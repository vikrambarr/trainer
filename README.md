# trainer
A small application that displays information scraped from pikalytics.com and calculations based off of an active Pokemon Showdown match.
Essentially a wrapper for showdown that allows you to start matches, save teams, and which provides a simple calulator and information from pikalytics during a match.

- Uses poke-env to start a battle in any category on pokemon showdown, which is then tracked and the app information updates as new pokemon information is revealed.
- The information is transfered to an application made in pygame, which then displays quick calculations, common movesets, items, and other data on the opposing pokemon.
- The application will have a tab for every pokemon on the opponent's team as well as a drop-down to select which pokemon on the user's team is used in the calculations.
- Possibly will add a luck calculator to do binomial distribution calcs on all of the probabilities involved in the match to determine a "luck" score.
